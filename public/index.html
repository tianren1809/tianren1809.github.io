          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>I am a cultural travel enthusiast, deeply curious about the world, and I firmly believe that every journey is a baptism for the soul and an expansion of one's horizons.<br>
            I am passionate about immersing myself in the unique charm of different civilizations, wandering through historic streets,and seeking out ancient buildings that carry the stories of time. <br>
            I am particularly captivated by diverse artistic expressions from around the globe whether they are classical masterpieces treasured in museums, <br>
            vibrant contemporary graffiti art in street corners, or exquisite handicrafts skillfully made by artisans in local markets, they all leave me spellbound. <br>
            For me, interacting with local people, experiencing their way of life, tasting their traditional cuisine,<br>
            and participating in their festive ceremonies are the most vivid and profound ways to understand a culture. <br>
            I yearn to feel the wisdom and customs passed down through generations through firsthand experience, <br>
            to discover the cultural gems hidden in everyday life, and to enrich my inner world with these colorful cultural imprints.

      <h2>My Recent Story</h2>
      <p>Recently, I've been focusing on documenting the intricate street art scenes in various European capitals. This project aims to capture the ephemeral nature of urban art and tell the stories of the artists behind these vibrant creations. It's been a fascinating exploration of modern culture expressed on city walls.</p>
